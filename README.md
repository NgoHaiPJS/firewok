# Firewok — Enhanced

An enhanced, interactive fireworks demo (based on the original project). Improvements include:

- Title bar with quick GitHub link and screenshot button
- Keyboard shortcuts: `S` to save screenshot, `P` to pause/play
- Slightly improved background and glow visuals
- Tiny feedback beep when saving a screenshot

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to run. To push changes to GitHub, run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Enhance UI, screenshot support, and visuals"
git remote add origin https://github.com/NgoHaiPJS/firewok.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you need me to attempt the git push from this machine, tell me and I'll try (it may require your credentials or SSH key).
